# UnitTesting-notes

A unit test is a piece of code that executes target code, typically a small unit like a class, method, or function, to confirm its correctness.
Unit tests provide quick feedback on whether the code behaves as expected.
They serve as automated regression tests and help in designing clear and understandable code.
Writing unit tests improves programmer confidence and serves as a form of documentation.

Configuring JUnit 5 in IntelliJ and Eclipse is straightforward, primarily done by creating a test class or method and allowing the IDE to manage dependencies.
The process of writing tests involves setting up the test environment, executing the target code, and verifying results using assertions.
Assertions like assertNotNull and assertEquals are commonly used in JUnit tests to verify expected behavior.
Tests can be executed within the IDE, providing quick feedback on the code's correctness.
Test failures provide valuable insights into potential bugs or issues in the code, helping to identify and resolve them efficiently.

Demonstration of Assertions Demonstrates modifying a test to introduce a failure and verifying the failure.
Introduces assertSame to compare object references and assertTrue/assertFalse to verify conditions.
Explains how assertSame compares object references directly, ensuring they point to the same object in memory.
Introduces a new feature, hasAppointment, in the ClinicCalendar class and writes test methods using assertTrue and assertFalse assertions.
Discusses collection assertions, such as assertEquals and assertIterableEquals, to compare collections of objects.
Demonstrates using assertEquals to compare collections and assertIterableEquals for comparing iterables.
Emphasizes the importance of assertions in testing and maintaining code confidence during refactoring.
Refactors code by extracting date pattern conversion logic into a separate method to improve code readability and maintainability.
Highlights the importance of test coverage in ensuring code correctness during refactoring.
Executes all tests after refactoring to ensure no regressions.
